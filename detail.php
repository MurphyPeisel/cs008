            <h3>Landfills</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                The most obvious drawback to not recycling is that 
                landfills will fill up significantly faster than if
                recycling were occurring. One major detriment attributed
                to landfills is the production of leachate. Leachate is
                concentrated wastewater that consists of the various
                chemicals that can be found in a landfill. Leachate can
                travel and contaminate the local bodies of water,
                rendering it non-potable. Recycling as much as possible
                minimizes the amount of trash that finds its way into
                landfills, helping to prevent the creation of leachate
                and the negative effects that are associated with it.
                The prevention of leachate production is more cost
                effective than cleaning up leachate as it's produced,
                so there's economical reason as well.

                When you recycle, you're putting something that you
                have used back into the system, which means that
                less of the materials that make up that product need 
                to be harvested (which is very costly on natural 
                habitats of animals). Additionally, other resources 
                are required to produce completely new items that
                could have been recycled. The fossil fuel use
                of tools used to harvest contribute towards the 
                changing of the climate, which would cause a large
                scale displacement of many, many animals on Earth.
                On an even simpler level, when waste doesn't get
                properly disposed of, it can end up in open landfills
                and even be dumped into the ocean. Animals, not knowing
                any better, will often eat and/or get stuck in 
                trash, which can lead to serious damage, even death.
